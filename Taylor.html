                    <p class="content">Do you know what makes it interesting about her songs? The intimacy. Her songs are so personal. That's what makes you think of her as a friend. She's an artist, of course some things she does are strategically made to sell (which also makes her an awesome businessperson) but you still can fell the feelings she was having when writing down the lyrics</p>

                    <p class="content">Some people may see her like the blondie girl with some famous ex's, or like a teen idle, but shes a lot more than that and giving a chance to her songs was the best thing i've done</p>
