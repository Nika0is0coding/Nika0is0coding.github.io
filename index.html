                    <p class="content">"Designed, engineered and built to be the best driver's car in the world", as McLaren itself describes, the P1 is an absolute beast. We have something know as the holy trinity of the cars, let's talk about them, starting with this one. <br>This hybrid smooth orange monster car has over 900bhp (903bhp, to be exact), goes from 0 to 100kmh in only 2,8sec, and from 0kmh to 200kmh in under 7sec, with a max speed of 350kmh. <br>As for the design... i'll let it speak for itself</p>
